Website Design, Plan & Brainstorm

Why am I building this website?

I am building this website to create a landing page for my own desktop app, Verify, which is a lightweight cross-platofrm assitant that verifies highlighted texts through efficiency LLM models (currently only offering OpenAI's GPT model). This website will introduce the app to it's consumers giving it a concrete breakdown from it's functions to pricing. It will be the tunnel that connects all marketing aspects of the app (including contact us, Instagram, Tiktok, FAQs etc.). 


Tools Used

This project is made on VSCode with programming languages HTML for the basic structure, CSS for the styling and designs and finally javascript for it's interactivity and modern/chic look. 
The website is hosted on Github pages and all the code is published onto Github Repo for public view.
