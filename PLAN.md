Website Design, Plan & Brainstorm

Why am I building this website?

I am building this website to create a landing page for my own desktop app, Verify, which is a lightweight cross-platofrm assitant that verifies highlighted texts through efficiency LLM models (currently only offering OpenAI's GPT model). This website will introduce the app to it's consumers giving it a concrete breakdown from it's functions to pricing. It will be the tunnel that connects all marketing aspects of the app (including contact us, Instagram, Tiktok, FAQs etc.). 


Tools Used

This project is made on VSCode with programming languages HTML for the basic structure, CSS for the styling and designs and finally javascript for it's interactivity and modern/chic look. 
The website is hosted on Github pages and all the code is published onto Github Repo for public view. 

Project Reflections and Struggles


Overall Atmosphere, aesthetic choice of website 
- modern, technology like, very minamilistic

brainstorm 3.0:
 My app essentially the idea of trying to make user's experience with using CHATGPT platforms much easier. inSTEAD of opening a new tab and going to the chatgpt website. my app which is a one time purchase of 2.99 helps make searching and verifying information much easier. with using hotkey shortcuts (command + enter for mac, contrl + enter for windows), users can access their chatgpt window in just two clicks. 
so here's the whole process.
you first have to download the chatgpt desktop app (for windows and mac). this will be how the chatgpt window is opened (it will not make the LLM model API affiliated with the the verify app)
you verify something by: highlighting the text you want to verify (works for a pdf, document, on a website anything that is in text), and after you click those hotkeys that will notifiy the computer, the chatgpt screen will pop up and a pre written prompt will be there to ask chatgpt to correctly verify the information.

here are some features:
you can make follow ups in the chat box. 
feel free to add more feature ideas in another section called aditional features
