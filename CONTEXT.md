Overview
Verify is a lightweight desktop utility designed to make fact-checking and information verification through ChatGPT faster and more convenient.
Instead of manually opening a new browser tab, navigating to the ChatGPT website, and copying/pasting text, Verify streamlines the process into two simple keystrokes.

Platform: macOS & Windows

Pricing: One-time purchase — $2.99

Core Purpose: Reduce friction in using ChatGPT for verification tasks.

How It Works
Prerequisite:

The user downloads the official ChatGPT desktop app (macOS or Windows).

Verify does not include or host an LLM; it simply opens the ChatGPT app and provides automation for verification.

Verification Process:

Step 1: Highlight any text you want to verify — this can be from a PDF, Word document, website, email, or any application that supports text selection.

Step 2: Use the hotkey shortcut:

macOS → Command + Enter

Windows → Ctrl + Enter

Step 3: Verify automatically launches the ChatGPT desktop window.

Step 4: A pre-written prompt is automatically inserted into the chat box, asking ChatGPT to fact-check the highlighted text.

Follow-Up:

After the initial verification, users can continue the conversation inside ChatGPT to refine the information, request sources, or ask related questions.

Key Features
Instant Access: Fact-check any selected text with just two keystrokes.

Cross-App Functionality: Works across all apps that support text selection (web browsers, PDF viewers, office apps, etc.).

Pre-Written Verification Prompt: Automatically formats and submits the query to ChatGPT for accuracy checking.

No API Key Required: Relies on the official ChatGPT desktop app rather than direct API integration.

Seamless Follow-Up: Continue the conversation without leaving the ChatGPT window.

Additional Feature Ideas
Customizable Hotkeys: Allow users to change shortcut keys to their preference.

Custom Prompt Templates: Let users edit or create their own verification prompts.

Quick History Access: A panel to view recent verifications for reference.

Multi-Language Support: Detect and verify text in different languages.

Theme & UI Personalization: Option to change appearance of the chat window trigger overlay.

Source Citation Mode: Prompt ChatGPT to always return credible sources and links for claims.

Offline Mode Reminder: Notify users if ChatGPT is offline or disconnected.

Value Proposition
By integrating hotkey-triggered automation with the ChatGPT desktop app, Verify eliminates unnecessary clicks and context switching. This enables researchers, students, journalists, and casual users to fact-check instantly, without breaking their reading or workflow.
